This project "CUSTOMER_SERVICE" demonstrates a RESTful API built using Spring Boot and MySQL, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The API interacts with a MySQL database, and operations are tested using "POSTMAN". Below are the supported HTTP methods:

POST: Insert new data into the MySQL database.
GET: Retrieve data from the database.
PUT: Update existing data in the database.
DELETE: Remove data from the database.
Postman is used to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints, allowing seamless interaction with the database.
Each endpoint maps directly to database operations, ensuring a smooth integration between the application and the database.
